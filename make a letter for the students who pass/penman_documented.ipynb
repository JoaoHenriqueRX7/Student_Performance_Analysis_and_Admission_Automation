    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook, my name is Jo√£o Henrique and we will explore the development and implementation of an script that reads student performance data from a CSV file, applies specific criteria to identify qualified candidates, and generates personalized admission letters for each selected candidate. This project is designed to showcase my ability to automate personalized document creation using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Throughout this notebook, we will:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Read a CSV file direct from kagle.\n",
    " - Implement and explain a series of functions to clean and preprocess the data:\n",
    " - fill_missing_values to handle missing data.\n",
    " - drop_duplicates to remove duplicate entries.\n",
    " - remove_outliers to identify and eliminate outliers from the data.\n",
    " - Apply these functions in a pipeline to streamline the data cleaning process.\n",
    " - Analyze the before and after effects of the cleaning process with visual and statistical comparisons."
